          <p>
            Hello, I’m Woohyeon Roh, a UI/UX developer based in South Korea. For past 3+ years, I've worked as a both designer and frontend developer with a UX driven background. Typography passionate, clean and pure code pursuing, I bridge the gap between design and development. I am able to quickly adapt to new challenges. Being quite hands-on, I enjoy getting involved in the whole process, starting from ideation and conceptualizing to designing, prototyping, and building. I also love learning new stuffs and endeavor to quickly follow latest trend of technology.
          </p>
