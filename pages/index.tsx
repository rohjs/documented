          Hello, Iâ€™m Woohyeon Roh, a UI/UX developer based in South Korea. For
          past 3+ years, I've worked as a both designer and frontend developer
          with a UX driven background. Typography passionate, clean and pure
          code pursuing, I bridge the gap between design and development. I am
          able to quickly adapt to new challenges. Being quite hands-on, I enjoy
          getting involved in the whole process, starting from ideation and
          conceptualizing to designing, prototyping, and building. I also love
          learning new stuff and endeavor to quickly follow latest trend of
          technology.
        </p>
